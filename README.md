## **Progress Tracker** 📊  
```  
 Total Tasks: 85  
 Completed: 10 🟢 | In Progress: 0 🟠 | Remaining: 75 🔴  
 Progress: 11.76%  
```  



### **How to Use**  
1. **Main Topics**:  
   - Mark the main topic as `🟢` when all its subtopics are completed.  
   - Automatically mark all subtopics under the main topic as `✅`.  
2. **Subtopics**:  
   - If you’re working on individual subtopics, mark them as:
     - ✅ for completed tasks
     - ⚙️ for in-progress tasks
     - ❌ for unstarted tasks  
3. **Progress Calculation**:  
   - Update the **Progress Tracker** manually:
     - Count the number of completed (`✅`) and in-progress (`⚙️`) tasks.
     - Calculate the percentage: `(Completed + InProgress * 0.5) / TotalTasks * 100`.  
4. Celebrate milestones by adding emojis like 🎉 or 🏆 next to completed sections!

**Happy Learning!** 🎓💻
